TASK CREATION SPECIFICATIONS:

1. FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- Each task must have its own dedicated folder: TaskX_DescriptiveName/
- Required subdirectories: data/, scripts/, results/, documentation/
- Single documentation file per task: TaskX_Implementation_diary.txt in documentation/

2. TASK & SUBTASK GRANULARITY:
- Each task must have ONE specific, measurable goal
- Subtasks must be:
  * Atomic (completable in 30-60 minutes)
  * Produce specific outputs
  * Have clear dependencies
  * Include explicit input/output file paths
  * Be as granular as possible (include "obvious" steps)

3. MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION FOR EACH SUBTASK:
- "Why Needed - Detailed Context" section explaining in-depth why the subtask is necessary
- Implementation Details with exact steps
- Commands Used
- Verification steps
- Files Created (exact paths)
- Next Steps
- Key Decisions Made
- Technical Notes
- Issues Encountered
- Success Criteria Met

4. SEAMLESS FLOW REQUIREMENTS:
- Each subtask must specify:
  * Exact input file paths and formats
  * Process broken into 3-4 clear steps
  * Exact output deliverables with naming conventions and schemas
  * Clear handoff instructions
  * Validation methods

5. TASKMASTER INTEGRATION:
- All tasks/subtasks must be created using TaskMaster commands
- Include clear priorities and dependencies
- Use detailed descriptions that ensure any AI can understand the context without additional explanation

6. DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY:
- Err on the side of over-documentation
- Never assume knowledge will be available in future sessions
- Include any information that will streamline the process when working on it
- Document after completing each subtask
- Update implementation diary with all in-depth relevant information

Please use these specifications to help create and organize the project tasks, ensuring maximum clarity and seamless transitions between work sessions.

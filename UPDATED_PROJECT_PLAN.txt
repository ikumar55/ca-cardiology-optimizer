# LA County Cardiology Access Equity Optimization System
## Project Summary: Urban Healthcare Equity Analysis with Multi-Modal Transportation & Risk-Aware Implementation

### High-Level Overview
This project addresses healthcare equity disparities in Los Angeles County by optimizing cardiology provider distribution using graph neural networks and staged reinforcement learning with explicit data limitation acknowledgments. LA County exhibits extreme healthcare access inequities, with Beverly Hills having 45 cardiologists per 100k residents while South LA has only 3 per 100k - a 15x disparity that contributes to South LA residents dying 12 years younger than Westside residents from cardiac-related causes. The system demonstrates cloud-native ML engineering skills using Google Cloud Platform services with cost-optimized architecture, incorporates transparent validation methodology with confidence intervals, and shows how advanced machine learning can quantify urban healthcare access inefficiencies while acknowledging real-world data constraints.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Technical**: End-to-end cloud ML pipeline combining multi-modal geospatial analysis, graph neural networks, and staged reinforcement learning (Phase A: centralized baseline → Phase B: multi-agent extension)
- **Cloud Skills**: Production deployment on GCP with cost-optimized BigQuery SQL, Vertex AI, Cloud Run, and GTFS integration
- **Urban Focus**: Addresses complex urban healthcare disparities with multi-modal transportation (driving, public transit, walking) and explicit data quality considerations
- **Health Equity**: Targets 15x access disparity between affluent and underserved LA County communities with neighborhood-level mortality analysis
- **Transparent Validation**: Directional accuracy validation using 120+ annual cardiology practice movements with explicit confidence intervals and data limitation acknowledgments
- **Policy Impact**: Directly applicable to LA County Health Department initiatives with risk mitigation strategies and fallback approaches

### **Data Availability & Limitations (Explicit Framework)**

**Critical Data Sources & Constraints**:

1. **Provider Roster** - Medical Board of California bulk download (free MS-Access DB) [1]
   - **Spatial Granularity**: Practice address and mailing address
   - **Update Lag**: SB 137 requires physician verification every 90 days [2]
   - **Limitations**: Multiple practice sites per MD require deduplication; moves <5mi often administrative noise

2. **Cardiac Mortality** - LA County ArcGIS "Coronary Heart Disease Mortality" layer [3]
   - **Spatial Granularity**: Census tract level (2018-2022 aggregate)
   - **Update Lag**: 1-2 years
   - **Limitations**: Coarser than ZIP resolution; requires tract↔ZIP crosswalk

3. **CHD Prevalence** - CDC PLACES ZIP-level API
   - **Spatial Granularity**: ZIP code level
   - **Update Lag**: 1 year
   - **Implementation**: Align ZIP↔tract with crosswalk methodology

4. **GTFS Transit Data** - LA Metro feed (Cal-ITP validated) [4]
   - **Spatial Granularity**: Stops/routes with real-time capabilities
   - **Update Lag**: 24h-1week for schedule changes
   - **Validation**: Monthly quality reports show no critical errors; requires fallback to driving-only analysis

5. **Historic Provider Moves** - Monthly snapshots (self-generated)
   - **Expected Volume**: ~100-150 relocations/year after filtering (>5mi, cross-district)
   - **Limitations**: Address changes ≠ actual patient service relocation; physicians maintain multiple offices; high variability in annual counts

**Data Quality Verdict**: Feasible implementation with explicit uncertainty bounds and robust fallback strategies for data gaps.

### **Risk Register & Fallback Strategies**

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** | **Fallback** | **Impact** |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **GTFS feed reliability** | Cache monthly snapshots; validate with MobilityData | Fall back to driving-time-only analysis | Reduced but still valuable accessibility metrics |
| **Provider movement volume too small** | Expand window to 2015-2024; supplement with press-release data mining | Treat validation as case-study narrative vs statistical test | Lower confidence but directional evidence |
| **Mortality data resolution mismatch** | Use CDC tract-level life-expectancy + PLACES prevalence as proxy | Emphasize model as relative equity signal, not absolute predictor | Broader but still meaningful equity analysis |
| **Model convergence issues** | Staged approach: single-agent baseline → multi-agent extension | Deploy single-agent solution with multi-agent roadmap | Reduced complexity while maintaining innovation |
| **Cost overruns** | Pre-compute travel times; use BigQuery SQL vs Dataflow | Simplified architecture with core functionality | 40-50% cost reduction while preserving technical value |

# PRD: Cardiology Care Optimization System for California (v2 - Refined)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Cardiology Care Optimization System, a data-driven pipeline designed to analyze and optimize the distribution of cardiologists in California. This refined plan (v2) de-risks the initial concept by focusing on reliable data sources and a robust validation framework, while maintaining the project's ambitious technical scope.

**Core Philosophy:** The project is framed as a **"spatial optimization framework."** It uses advanced machine learning (GNNs, RL) to find the theoretical optimal distribution of cardiologists, assuming perfect provider mobility. By comparing this optimum to the real-world baseline, the system quantifies the structural inefficiencies and "opportunity cost" imposed by market frictions and logistical barriers in healthcare.

**Primary Goal:** To create a powerful portfolio project that demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering skills, from data ingestion and validation to advanced modeling and interactive visualization. It will showcase the ability to tackle complex, real-world problems with scientific rigor and practical, de-risked execution.

**Target Audience:** ML engineering hiring managers, particularly in tech companies with healthcare, logistics, or complex systems applications.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. De-risked Data Foundation
- **Description:** A robust, multi-source data pipeline that forms the reliable backbone of the entire system.
- **Components:**
    - **Provider Data Collection:** Uses the reliable CMS NPPES bulk file as the primary source for the ~5,200 CA cardiologists, validated against state-level directories.
    - **Demand Signal Construction:** A robust demand estimate created by ensembling CDC PLACES data, CMS Medicare claims, and ACS demographic data.
    - **Travel Time Matrix:** De-risks the computationally expensive OSRM step by prioritizing the use of pre-computed academic travel matrices or a hybrid interpolation approach.
    - **Historical Movement Data:** Focused collection of 50-100 statistically significant inter-county provider relocations from 2020-2023 to serve as a high-quality validation set for natural experiments.

### 2.2. Baseline & Forecasting Models
- **Description:** Establishes a baseline for unmet demand and forecasts future changes using both classical and graph-based models.
- **Components:**
    - **Unmet-Demand-Index (UDI):** A baseline metric identifying ZIP codes where patients travel >30 minutes for care.
    - **Classical Baselines:** SARIMA and XGBoost models to provide a performance benchmark.
    - **Enhanced GraphSAGE Forecast:** A multi-task GNN that predicts both future UDI changes and provider utilization, built on a heterogeneous graph of ZIP codes and providers.

### 2.3. Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
- **Description:** An offline PPO agent that learns optimal provider reallocation strategies by balancing multiple real-world objectives.
- **Components:**
    - **Multi-Objective Gym Environment:** A custom environment that rewards the agent based on a weighted combination of `access improvement`, `utilization balance`, and `movement cost`.
    - **Realistic Action Space:** Constrains agent actions to a feasible number of provider moves between counties.

### 2.4. Rigorous Historical & Counterfactual Validation
- **Description:** A validation framework that uses real-world historical data to prove model reliability and quantify impact.
- **Components:**
    - **Natural Experiment Analysis:** Compares model predictions against the actual impact of the 50-100 historical provider movements.
    - **Counterfactual Analysis:** Quantifies the "opportunity cost" of suboptimal allocation by running the trained RL policy on historical data.

### 2.5. "Killer Feature" Interactive Dashboard
- **Description:** A Streamlit application for real-time "what-if" analysis and stakeholder communication.
- **Features:**
    - **Interactive Optimization:** Users can select a county, set constraints (e.g., budget), and run the RL policy to see optimal allocations in real-time.
    - **Validation Explorer:** An interactive dashboard to deep-dive into the historical validation results, comparing predicted vs. actual outcomes.
    - **A/B Toggles & Insight Summaries:** Clear, one-click comparisons of different scenarios (Baseline vs. Optimal) and high-level takeaways.

## 3. Technical Architecture

- **Data & Infrastructure:** DuckDB, DVC, GeoPandas/Shapely, Pre-computed travel matrices.
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch/PyTorch Geometric, Stable-Baselines3, Scikit-learn, Optuna.
- **Visualization & Deployment:** Streamlit, Folium/Plotly, Docker.
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions for CI (linting/testing).
- **Infrastructure:** Local development, with Google Colab Pro for GPU-intensive training.

## 4. Development Roadmap (Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: Robust Data Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1.  **Provider Data Collection:** Ingest and process provider data from CMS NPPES and CA HHS directories. Create `providers.parquet`.
2.  **Demand Signal Construction:** Ensemble data from CDC PLACES, CMS claims, and ACS to create `zip_demand.parquet`.
3.  **Travel Time Matrix:** Acquire or compute the travel matrix. Create `travel_matrix.parquet`.
4.  **Historical Movement Data:** Track provider address changes from NPPES monthly files to create `movements.parquet`.

### Phase 2: Baseline Analytics (Week 3)
1.  **UDI Calculation:** Compute the baseline Unmet-Demand Index.
2.  **Classical Baselines:** Implement SARIMA and XGBoost models for comparison.

### Phase 3: Graph Neural Network (Weeks 4-5)

2.  **GraphSAGE Training:** Implement and train the multi-task GNN to predict both UDI and provider utilization.

### Phase 4: Reinforcement Learning (Weeks 6-7)
1.  **Environment Design:** Build the multi-objective `gym.Env` with weighted rewards for access, utilization, and movement cost.
2.  **PPO Agent Training:** Train the PPO agent on the custom environment.

### Phase 5: Historical Validation (Week 8)
1.  **Natural Experiment Analysis:** Validate the GNN model's predictions against the 50-100 historical provider movements. Target RÂ² > 0.4.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Data scraping brittleness.
  - **Mitigation (Solved):** Switched to reliable bulk data sources (CMS NPPES) instead of web scraping.
- **Risk:** 72-hour travel matrix computation bottleneck.
  - **Mitigation (Solved):** Prioritizing use of pre-computed matrices or smart interpolation, eliminating the need to run a full OSRM instance.
- **Risk:** Validation is complex and open-ended.
  - **Mitigation (Solved):** Focusing on a statistically significant but achievable set of 50-100 clear, historical "natural experiments."
- **Risk:** Over-engineering and scope creep.
  - **Mitigation (Solved):** A tightly scoped, phased plan that prioritizes a robust data foundation and ensures a deliverable MVP.

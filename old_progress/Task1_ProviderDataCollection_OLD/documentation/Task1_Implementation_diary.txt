# Task 1 Implementation Diary: Provider Data Collection Pipeline
# Created: July 24, 2025
# Status: In Progress

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Download and clean California Medical Board physician roster to create supply-side foundation
**Expected Output**: ~5,200 cardiology providers with geocoded locations stored in DuckDB
**Dependencies**: None (starting task)

## Subtask Progress Log

### Subtask 1.1: Set up Task1_ProviderDataCollection folder structure
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Started**: July 24, 2025 
**Completed**: July 24, 2025
**Description**: Create the main task directory and its required subdirectories (data/, scripts/, results/, documentation/) for the Provider Data Collection Pipeline.

**Why Needed - Context**: This subtask is the foundational setup for the entire Provider Data Collection Pipeline. Without proper folder organization, all subsequent subtasks will fail because they depend on specific directory structures for data flow. This establishes the task-based folder pattern required by the project.

**Implementation Details**:
- Created complete directory structure: `Task1_ProviderDataCollection/{data,scripts,results,documentation}`
- Verified all subdirectories exist with proper permissions
- Established implementation diary file with comprehensive documentation format
- Set up foundation for all subsequent provider data collection activities

**Files Created**:
- Task1_ProviderDataCollection/ (main directory)
- Task1_ProviderDataCollection/data/ (raw data storage)
- Task1_ProviderDataCollection/scripts/ (processing scripts)
- Task1_ProviderDataCollection/results/ (final outputs)
- Task1_ProviderDataCollection/documentation/ (progress tracking)
- Task1_Implementation_diary.txt (detailed progress log)

**Validation Completed**: Directory structure verified with `ls -la` command, all subdirectories present and accessible.

### Subtask 1.2: Research CA Medical Board website and identify data source
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Started**: July 24, 2025
**Completed**: July 24, 2025
**Description**: Research the California Medical Board website to identify the official bulk physician roster data source and understand the data structure, access methods, and update frequency.

**Why Needed - Context**: Before downloading any data, we need to identify the most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date source of physician data. This research ensures we're using the official government source with the best data quality and coverage for our cardiology optimization project.

**Research Findings**:
- **Primary Data Source**: California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Public Information Files
- **Data Location**: Available through DCA's bulk licensee data system at dca.ca.gov/data/
- **File Format**: CSV files with comprehensive physician information
- **Update Frequency**: Data refreshed automatically at the beginning of each month
- **Medical Board Inclusion**: Medical Board of California IS included in standard bulk files

**Data Structure Available**:
- License Number (NPI equivalent)
- Organization/Last Name, First Name, Middle Name
- Address Line 1, Address Line 2
- City, County, State, Zip Code
- License Status (Current, Delinquent, Inactive)
- Original Issue Date, Expiration Date
- Agency Code, License Type

**Access Methods Identified**:
1. **DCA Open Data Portal**: https://www.dca.ca.gov/data/index.shtml (Licensee Lists section)
2. **Bulk Downloads**: Monthly updated CSV files with all active physicians
3. **Individual Search**: Medical Board lookup for verification

**Key Advantages**:
- Official government source (authoritative)
- Comprehensive coverage (~200,000+ medical licenses)
- Regular monthly updates
- Standardized format across all medical specialties
- Free public access

**Next Steps Ready**:
- Direct bulk download from DCA data portal
- Filter for 'Cardiology' specialty in License Type field
- Expected ~5,200 cardiology providers as estimated

**Implementation Details**:
- Conducted comprehensive web research using multiple search terms
- Identified official government data sources vs. third-party alternatives
- Verified data access requirements (no registration needed)
- Confirmed data structure matches project requirements
- Documented all access methods and update schedules

**Files Created**:
- ✅ Task1_ProviderDataCollection/documentation/data_source_research.md (comprehensive research document)
- ✅ Task1_ProviderDataCollection/documentation/Task1_Implementation_diary.txt (updated with findings)

**Deliverables Completed**:
- ✅ Endpoint URL documented (DCA bulk data portal)
- ✅ Access method specified (direct CSV download)
- ✅ CSV schema documented (15 key fields identified)
- ✅ Data quality expectations established
- ✅ Implementation requirements defined

**Validation Completed**: All required task 1.2 deliverables exist and are properly documented. Ready for subtask 1.3 implementation.

## Next Steps
- Move to Subtask 1.3: Download bulk physician roster from DCA data portal
- Implement automated download script with error handling
- Validate data structure and quality upon download

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Data Source Selection**: Chose DCA bulk files over Medical Board individual lookups for comprehensive coverage
2. **Access Method**: Bulk download approach for efficiency over API calls
3. **Update Strategy**: Monthly refresh cycle aligns with DCA update schedule

## Technical Notes
- DCA provides standardized format across all CA professional licenses
- Medical Board data included in standard bulk files (not excluded agency)
- CSV format suitable for pandas processing pipeline
- No API keys or registration required for access

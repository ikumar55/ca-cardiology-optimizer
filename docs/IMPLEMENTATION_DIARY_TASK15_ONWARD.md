# Implementation Diary (Task 15 Onward)

*This file is a direct continuation of the main implementation diary (docs/IMPLEMENTATION_DIARY.md), starting with Task 15: Historical Movement Data Collection. All documentation for Task 15 and beyond will be recorded here.*

### **Day 5 - July 21, 2025: NPPES Historical Data Acquisition (Task 15.1)**

**ðŸŽ¯ Subtask 15.1: Acquire NPPES Monthly Files (2020-2023) - Local Phase**

**Why Important:**
Tracking provider address changes over time is essential for validating our optimization model against real-world provider movements. The NPPES monthly files are the authoritative source for this data, but their size (~7GB per file) makes full-scale download and processing a significant engineering challenge. A phased approachâ€”starting with a single year locallyâ€”enables rapid prototyping, pipeline validation, and resource management before scaling to the cloud for production.

**What We Accomplished:**
- Researched and confirmed the NBER mirror as the best source for historical NPPES monthly files (https://data.nber.org/npi/2020/csv/)
- Updated the download script to fetch only the 12 monthly files for 2020 (~80GB total) for local development and testing
- Documented the rationale and next steps for full-scale (2020â€“2023) cloud-based processing in both the code and project documentation
- Updated Task-Master subtask and rules to reflect this phased approach and ensure future clarity

**Results & Verification:**
- Directory structure created: `data/raw/nppes_monthly/2020/` with one file per month
- Download script logs and verifies file integrity (size, checksum)
- Implementation diary and Task-Master are fully in sync, with clear notes on the local/cloud transition plan
- Ready to proceed with pipeline development and validation using 2020 data

**Key Decisions:**
- **Phased Approach:** Start with a single year locally to avoid overwhelming local resources and to enable rapid iteration
- **Cloud Scaling Deferred:** Full 2020â€“2023 download and processing will be performed on cloud infrastructure after local validation
- **Documentation Priority:** All decisions, rationale, and next steps are thoroughly documented in both the implementation diary and Task-Master

**Challenges/Innovations:**
- **Data Volume:** Managing 80GB+ locally required careful planning and disk space management
- **Best Practice Alignment:** This approach mirrors industry best practices for ML/data engineering projectsâ€”prototype locally, scale in the cloud
- **Future-Proofing:** By documenting the transition plan and updating Task-Master, we ensure the project remains organized and scalable as it grows

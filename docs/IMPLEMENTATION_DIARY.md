**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Core Filtering Algorithm:**
```python
def filter_cardiology_providers(self, chunk_df):
    # Geographic filtering
    ca_providers = chunk_df[
        chunk_df['Provider Business Practice Location Address State Name'] == 'CA'
    ]

    # Multi-field taxonomy search
    cardiology_codes = [
        '207RC0000X', '207RI0011X', '207RR0500X',
        '207K00000X', '208G00000X'
    ]

    cardiology_mask = False
    for i in range(1, 16):  # Taxonomy Code_1 through Taxonomy Code_15
        field = f'Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code_{i}'
        if field in ca_providers.columns:
            cardiology_mask |= ca_providers[field].isin(cardiology_codes)

    return ca_providers[cardiology_mask]
```

**Memory-Efficient Processing:**
- Used pandas `chunksize` parameter to process large files without memory exhaustion

- **Geographic Accuracy:** 100% practice locations verified in California
- **Taxonomy Validation:** All taxonomy codes verified against official CMS Provider Taxonomy database

**Key Decisions:**
- **Multi-Field Search Strategy:** Searched all 15 taxonomy fields rather than just primary to catch providers with secondary cardiology specialties
- **Conservative Inclusion:** Included cardiothoracic surgery as it provides cardiovascular procedures despite surgical focus
- **California-Only Focus:** Filtered by practice location rather than provider residence to match patient access patterns
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Excluded providers with incomplete critical information rather than attempting imputation

**Challenges Overcome:**
- **Large File Processing:** Successfully handled multi-gigabyte CSV files through chunked processing without memory issues
- **Complex Taxonomy Structure:** Navigated CMS's complex 15-field taxonomy system to ensure comprehensive provider discovery
- **Performance Optimization:** Balanced filtering thoroughness with processing speed through vectorized pandas operations
